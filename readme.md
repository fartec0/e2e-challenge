## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v22.14 or later) - Download from nodejs.org or use nvm
  `nvm install 22.14`
  `nvm use 22.14`

---

## Installation

1. **Clone** this repository (or download the source).
2. **Install dependencies**:

   `npm install`


---

## Running the App

1. **Serve** the app locally:

   `vite` or `npm run dev`
   
   It will compile and run the React app on **<http://localhost:5173/>** by default.

2. **Open** your browser at <http://localhost:5173/>.

---

## Running Tests

1. **Make sure the app is running** in another terminal window:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
2. **Run all tests**:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. **Run specific test suite**:

   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/accessibility.spec.js
   ```

4. **View test reports**:

   ```bash
   npm run test:report
   ```

## Test Suites

### Basic Tests

Located in `tests/example.spec.js`
- **Basic test**: Verifies that the application loads correctly with the expected page title.

### Accessibility Tests

Located in `tests/accessibility.spec.js`
- **Should have proper semantic structure**: Ensures the application has appropriate DOM structure.
- **All images should have alt text**: Verifies that all images in the application have alt text for screen readers.
- **Should have sufficient color contrast**: Tests that the application has readable color contrast.

### Compatibility Tests

Located in `tests/compatibility.spec.js`
- **Should render correctly in different browsers**: Validates the application works in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Should display properly on different viewports**: Ensures responsive design works on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile screen sizes.

### Performance Tests

Located in `tests/performance.spec.js`
- **Page load time should be acceptable**: Verifies that the application loads within an acceptable timeframe (under 3 seconds).
- **Animations should be smooth**: Checks that animations in the application run smoothly.
- **Should not have memory leaks**: Monitors memory usage to detect potential memory leaks.

### Reliability Tests

Located in `tests/reliability.spec.js`
- **Should handle repeated interactions**: Tests application stability under rapid user interactions.
- **Should recover from errors**: Validates that the application can recover gracefully from JavaScript errors.
- **Should handle network fluctuations**: Ensures the application remains functional during offline/online transitions.

### Security Tests

Located in `tests/security.spec.js`
- **Should have appropriate Content Security Policy headers**: Checks for proper security headers.
- **Should sanitize user input to prevent XSS**: Tests protection against cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Should use HTTPS for external resources**: Verifies that external resources are loaded securely.

### Scalability Tests

Located in `tests/scalability.spec.js`
- **Should handle large data loads**: Tests application performance with large datasets.
- **Should handle concurrent operations**: Validates the application's behavior under concurrent user sessions.
- **Should maintain performance under load**: Ensures performance doesn't degrade significantly under load.

## Testing Strategy

This project uses a Page Object Model (POM) pattern for organizing and maintaining test code. The POM pattern improves test maintainability by separating page-specific logic from test logic.

For detailed information about our POM implementation, please see:
- [POM-STRATEGY.md](POM-STRATEGY.md)

Additional project documentation:
- [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md) - Guidelines for contributors
- [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) - Planned improvements to the test suite

## Instructions

1. Add a playwright testing suite to the project

2. Add some end-to-end tests in a way you believe is most efficient.

3. Creating a Page Object Model (POM) to assist your tests if you want to, this is not mandatory.

4. Avoid modifying the applicationâ€™s source files directly, if possible.
5. Using any type of AI is permitted and encouraged

## Submitting Your Test

After completing the challenge, please follow these steps to submit your work for evaluation:

1. Create a new **private repository** on GitHub.
2. Add a new readme or edit this one with the instructions about how to run your tests
3. Add the following GitHub user as a collaborator so we can access and review your solution:
`gabrielbs`, `hugodom`
